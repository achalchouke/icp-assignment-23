# Switch Case
## Switch Case
The switch statement in JavaScript provides a way to perform different actions based on different conditions. It evaluates an expression or variable and then matches its value to various cases. When a case matches, the corresponding code block is executed. This is especially useful when you have multiple conditions to check against a single value.
